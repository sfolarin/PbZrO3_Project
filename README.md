# PbZrO3_Project
Creating Thin Films from PZO Pbam Structure
In this project, I made 3, 5, and 7 monolayer thin films from bulk PZO (Pbam) space group using VESTA, I then used Quantum Espresso to compute the
Density of States to know if the material is an insulator or a conductor. Afterwards, I computed projected density of states to know the orbital hybridization 
of each atoms. I also plotted layer resolved DOS
